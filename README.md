## R1: Explain the problem that PET STORE API will solve, and explain how this app solves or addresses the problem.

### Problem Significance for Pet Store API

The motivation to create the PET STORE API came from a personal experience of trying to buy a bird feeder online but being unable to find the desired product without visiting multiple stores. By creating the Pet Shop API, I aim to eliminate such frustrations for other pet owners, offering a seamless and efficient shopping experience that meets their needs conveniently.

The Pet Store API addresses a significant gap in the pet supply market by offering a centralized platform for pet owners to find a store and purchase pet items. Traditional shopping methods often require visiting multiple stores to find specific petitems, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. The Pet Store API streamlines the process, making it easier for users to locate and buy the petitems they need.

Furthermore, The Pet Store API supports businesses by providing a robust system to manage stores, petitems and promotions effectively using badges. This leads to better user experience, as stores can ensure they have the right petitems available at the right times. It also allows for dynamic marketing strategies, such as applying discounts to specific petitems, which can drive sales and enhance customer satisfaction.

   - Example - Read operation from User.
   - ```python
        if UserModel.query.filter(UserModel.username == user_data["username"]).first():
        abort(409, message="A user with that username already exists.")
     ```

3. Relationships and Joins

   - Easily navigate and query related data using SQLAlchemy relationship management.

4. Transactions and Sessions

   - Manage transactions and sessions to ensure data consistency.

### Conclusion

## R6: Design an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for Pet Store REST API app database, and explain how the relations between the diagrammed models will aid the database design. 

### Database design BEFORE coding started - The project planning phase.

attach the diagram here. 

### Entities

   - Store
   - Badge
   - PetItem
   - User

### many-to-many relationship between PetItem and Badge
1. Relationship between Badges and PetItems

   - One PetItem can have many badges
   - One Badge can have many PetItems

2. In many-to-many relationship, one model could not have a single value as a foreign key.
   So we need another table (a secondary table) that has, in each row, a Badge ID and PetItem ID.

3. As an Example - 

   Entity Name - petitem_badge
   Table name - petitems_badges
   ```
   id , badge_id, petitem_id
   1      2          3
   2      2          4
   3      4          1
   4      3          1
   ```
4. Explanation of the table - petitems_badges

   - Badge with ID 2 is linked to petitems with IDs 3 and 4
   - Badge with ID 4 is linked to petitem with ID 1
   - Badge with ID 3 is linked to petitem with ID 1

   Because of that

   - petitem with IDs 3 and 4 are linked to Badge with ID 2
   - petitem with ID 1 is linked to Badge with ID 4
   - petitem with ID 1 is linked to Badge with ID 3

5. many-to-many relationships use a secondary table which stores which models of one side are related to which models of the other side.
6. This is how many-to-many relationships work. It is through the above secondary table. The Badge.petitems and PetItem.badges attributes will be populated by SQLAlchemy.
7. The rows in this table keep a link between a specific badge and a specific petitem.
   But without the need for those values to be stored in the badge or petitem models themselves.
### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and PetItems

   - One-to-many relationship between Store and PetItems
   - One Store can have many PetItems
   - Each PetItem has one Store

### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and Badges

   - One Store can have many Badges
   - Each Badge has one Store

### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and Users

   - One Store can have many Users
   - Each User has one Store

## R7: Explain the implemented models and their relationships, including how the relationships aid the database implementation.

### Database implementation AFTER coding has started - The project development phase of Pet Store REST API.

The models used in Pet Store REST API are in different files within the models folder. 

`StoreModel`
```python
class StoreModel(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "stores"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    store_name = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    store_location = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)

    petitems = db.relationship("PetItemModel", back_populates="store", lazy="dynamic", cascade="all, delete")
    badges = db.relationship("BadgeModel", back_populates="store", lazy="dynamic")
```
#### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and PetItems

   - One-to-many relationship between Store and PetItems
   - One Store can have many PetItems
   - Each PetItem has one Store

#### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and Badges

   - One Store can have many Badges
   - Each Badge has one Store

#### The above code snippet db.relationship command defines the relationship between the models in the Pet Store REST API

```python
petitems = db.relationship("PetItemModel", back_populates="store", lazy="dynamic", cascade="all, delete")
```
   - One Store can have many PetItems
   - Each PetItem belongs to a single store. 
   - If we want to delete a store which has attached petitems then it won't allow us to delete the store. 
   - When we delete a model that has a relationship to other models that still exist, then the default behavior in SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL is to raise an error. 
   - This is because SQLAlchemy does not want to allow us to accidentally delete data that is still being used by other models.
   - Let's say we have a store 1 that has two petitems, petitem 1 and petitem 2. 
   - If we try to delete store 1 without first deleting petitem 1 and petitem 2, SQLAlchemy will raise an error because the petitems are still attached to the store.
   - This means the petitems have a Foreign Key that references the store we are trying to delete. If the store actually was deleted, then the petitems have a store ID that references something that doesn't exist.
   - To fix the issue, we can use a feature called "cascading deletes". Cascading deletes allow us to specify that when a model is deleted, any related models should also be deleted automatically.


`PetItemModel`
```python
class PetItemModel(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "petitems"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    item_name = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    item_description = db.Column(db.String(100))
    price = db.Column(db.Float(precision=2), unique=False, nullable=False)
    store_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("stores.id"), unique=False, nullable=False)

    store = db.relationship("StoreModel", back_populates="petitems")
    badges = db.relationship("BadgeModel", back_populates="petitems", secondary="petitems_badges")
```
#### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and PetItems

   - One-to-many relationship between Store and PetItems
   - One Store can have many PetItems
   - Each PetItem has one Store
   - store_id ForeignKey references stores table

`BadgeModel`
```python
class BadgeModel(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "badges"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    badge_name = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    colour_code = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=False, nullable=False)
    discount = db.Column(db.Float(precision=2), unique=False, nullable=False)
    store_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("stores.id"), nullable=False)

    store = db.relationship("StoreModel", back_populates="badges")
    petitems = db.relationship("PetItemModel", back_populates="badges", secondary="petitems_badges")
```
#### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and Badges

   - One Store can have many Badges
   - Each Badge has one Store
   - store_id ForeignKey references stores table

`PetItemBadgeModel`
```python
class PetItemBadgeModel(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "petitems_badges"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    petitem_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("petitems.id"))
    badge_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("badges.id"))
```
#### many-to-many relationship between PetItem and Badge
1. Relationship between Badges and PetItems

   - One PetItem can have many badges
   - One Badge can have many PetItems

2. In many-to-many relationship, one model could not have a single value as a foreign key.
   So we need another table (a secondary table) that has, in each row, a Badge ID and PetItem ID.

3. As an Example - 

   Entity Name - petitem_badge
   Table name - petitems_badges
   ```
   id , badge_id, petitem_id
   1      2          3
   2      2          4
   3      4          1
   4      3          1
   ```
4. ForeignKey references

   - petitem_id ForeignKey references petitems table
   - badge_id ForeignKey references badges table

`UserModel`
```python
class UserModel(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
```
#### One-to-many Relationship between Stores and Users

   - One Store can have many Users
   - Each User has one Store
